Although EosOS Linux is designed to work as best as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more, or just want to personalize it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!

<b>Search the web</b>

Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favorite search engine. Just include words like 'Linux', 'EosOS Linux' or 'Arch' in your search query.
As EosOS Linux is based on Arch Linux, guides and tips designed for Arch usually apply to EosOS Linux too.

<b>Look in the forums</b>

For specific help with EosOS Linux we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions.
The EosOS Linux forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!
